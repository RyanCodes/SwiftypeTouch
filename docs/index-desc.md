SwiftypeTouch is a library for iOS that makes adding Swiftype-powered search to your app simple. For an example of its use, see the [SwiftypeTouchExample](https://github.com/swiftype/SwiftypeTouchExample) application.

SwiftypeTouch uses the [Swiftype API](http://swiftype.com/documentation/overview), so you should be familiar with it. For crawler-based engines, the STPageDocumentTypeResultsObject gives a quick way to get started.
